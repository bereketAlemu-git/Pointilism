# Pointilism
Pointillism is a painting technique using colored dots to form images. This program reads a source image, scales it up, and creates a new image in a pointillist style.

To run:
Enter to the terminal: python pointilism.py path/to/source_image.png

This is from the course 1405 at carleton University
